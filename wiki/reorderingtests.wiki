=Test for Reordering Edit-Inlines=

We have tested the new functionality for Edit-Inlines very carefully. Of course, there could still be some cases where errors occur. Therefore, we´ve put together a list of tests we are running on a regular basis.

===Tabular===

The Model includes !ForeignKeys as well as Generic Relations, Input-Fields, Selects and Checkboxes.

  * *Delete one Item:* xxx
  * *Delete multiple Items:* xxx
  * *Move one Item:* xxx
  * *Move multiple Items:* xxx


===Stacked===

The Model includes !ForeignKeys as well as Generic Relations, Input-Fields, Selects and Checkboxes. We´ve also included TinyMCE for testing Stacked-Inlines.

  * *Delete one Item:* xxx
  * *Delete multiple Items:* xxx
  * *Move one Item:* xxx
  * *Move multiple Items:* xxx
