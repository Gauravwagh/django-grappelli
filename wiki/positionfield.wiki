=Position-Field=

Making Generic Relations work/look like !ForeignKeys: When editing a Generic Relation, you first choose the Content Type and then the Object-ID. With Grappelli, you instantly get the related object displayed right near the Object-ID.

===All you have to do is add a js to your Admin===
{{{
class MyModelOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ...
    class Media:
        js = [
            '/media/admin/js/admin/Generic.js',
        ]
}}}

*The original implementation of the Position-Field is done by Joel Watts. For more details, please take a look at* http://code.google.com/p/django-positions/. (Thanks Joel for letting me use your work).
