= Available Settings =

All Settings can be defined in your projects settings-file (settings.py) or the !FileBrowsers settings-file (fb_settings.py). When using the projects settings-file, you have to use the prefix "FILEBROWSER_" for every setting (e.g. FILEBROWSER_PATH_SERVER instead of PATH_SERVER).

----
==== URL_WWW ====
The location of your media-files. This is the base URL for all your media-files accessible for the !FileBrowser.
{{{
URL_WWW = getattr(settings, "FILEBROWSER_URL_WWW", '/media/uploads/')
}}}
Note: When you set URL_WWW to settings.MEDIA_URL you can use all your media-files with the !FileBrowser. Nevertheless, you may want to limit this to a subdirectory of settings.MEDIA_URL or a seperate media-server.

*Important: If you change this setting, you should also change PATH_SERVER.*
