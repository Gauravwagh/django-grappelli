= Available Settings =

All Settings can be defined in your projects settings-file (settings.py) or the Grappelli settings-file (settings.py). When using the projects settings-file, you have to use the prefix "GRAPPELLI_" for every setting (e.g. GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE instead of ADMIN_TITLE).

----
==== ADMIN_TITLE ====
The Site Title of your Admin-Interface. Change this instead of changing index.html.
{{{
ADMIN_TITLE = getattr(settings, "GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_TITLE", 'Grappelli')
}}}
----
==== ADMIN_URL ====
The URL to your admin-installation. Necessary in order to get the right URLs - in my opinion, this is a bug with the current version of django.
{{{
ADMIN_URL = getattr(settings, "GRAPPELLI_ADMIN_URL", 'admin')
}}}
