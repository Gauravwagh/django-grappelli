Grappelli is not only a skin for django.contrib.admin. It is a skin for django-admin-tools too. Thus grappelli has it's old bookmarks feature back. Additionally you can customize the order and hierarchy of the admin index and app_index, add modules like "Recent Actions", and some more very nice features from admin-tools.

Basically it works like described in the admin-tools docu http://packages.python.org/django-admin-tools/ but some things are different or not (yet) supported when using admin-tools with grappelli...



===special/additional css classes===

 * collapse, open/close works as opt. in for dashboard modules. pretty much the same as with inlines.

 * Every direct children of the dashboard needs a css class named "column_1", "column_2" or "column_3". This css class defines where the module is rendered.


===supported with grappelli===
Here a list of all admin_tools features that work with grappelli as skin:

 * admin/index and admin/app_index customization
 * menu customization
 * bookmarks in menu

===not supported with grappelli===
Features not (yet) implemented in grappelli (we will announce new features asap. so please don't ask).

 * drag&drop and delete of dashboard modules (pretty much all the user can customize isn't implemented)
 * Group class: templates ignore display setting (‘tabs’, ‘accordion’, ‘stacked’). looks always the same
