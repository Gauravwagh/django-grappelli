=!InlineModelAdmin Options=

With Grappelli, you get some additional attributes for defining your !InlineModelAdmin.

==collapse-open, collapse-closed==

[http://vonautomatisch.at/media/uploads/grappelli/collapsed_fields.jpg]

You have two options for displaying inline-groups. With *"collapse-open"*, the inline-group is collapsible and open by default. With *"collapse-closed"*, the inline-group is collapsible but closed by default. Without using a class, the inline-group wonÂ´t be collapsible.
{{{
class NavigationItemInline(admin.StackedInline):
    
    classes = ('collapse-open',)
    ...
}}}
