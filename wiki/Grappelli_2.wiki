Here´s a list with the most important changes:
  * Refactored Stylesheets (including re-writing lots of stuff).
  * CSS cleanup (decoupled styles from Djangos original stylesheets).
  * Removed all Background-Images (excluding Icons). Note: With using Safari, you still have the option of Gradients.
  * Removed almost every !important within Stylesheets.
  * Some Template Changes: Most notable within the Changelist, where we´ve decided to move all Search/Filter functions to the Sidebar.
  * Icon Updates.
  * TinyMCE Skin Update.
  * Updated to work with Django 1.1.
  * Removed the need for additional context-processors.
  * Updated Bookmark functionality.

Still TODO:
  * Styling the Documentation.
  * Styling the Help-Section.
  * Testing.
