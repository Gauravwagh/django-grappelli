=Django Issues=

There are some known problems with the Django admin-interface. I´m going to list them here in order to avoid confusion (because the problems are not related to Grappelli whatsoever).

If you think there´s something missing here (or if an Issue has been resolved), please drop me an email.

==Reordering Edit-Inlines==

Because in case of errors, formsets are not returned in the right order, reordering inlines is currently not possible.<br>
(_Solution seems to be coming soon.)_

==Translating App Names==

It´s not possible to translate the names of apps within the admin-interface which leads to a strange language mix (esp. on the index page).<br>
(_There´s already a ticket and this should be solved soon.)_

==The Admin Index Site==

Currently, the admin index site reflects the structure of your applications/models. I don´t think editors (who use the admin site) are interested in the structure of the application. What they want is the most reasonable list of models, divided into different sections (not necessarily apps).<br>
(_The Django Developers don´t agree with this and therefore this probably won´t be solved.)_

==Admin Site Objects and Related Lookups==

If you use different Admin Site Objects, you have to register every (!) related model within ever site object you want to use that model for. The problem here is somehow similar to the one mentioned before: Editors are just not interested in the underlying structure and still, they are forced to deal with it.
Instead of customizing _every_ adminsite index template, Grappelli assumes that you registered _all_ models with your main adminsite.<br>
(_This is not considered a bug by the django developers. So, it probably won´t be solved.)_

==Searching Generic Relations==

It´s not possible to use a "content_object" within the search_fields. As far as I know, there´s no workaround.<br>
(_I´m not sure if this will be solved.)_

==Messages in Admin==

It´s currently not possible to distinguish between Success- and Error-Messages.

==M2M RawID Field has no Unicode representation==

see http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10293 ... the Patch provided there does work.

== Popups, Actions and list_editables==

With the current version of Django, Actions are visible within popups but delete confirmation doesn´t handle popups correctly. Moreover, list_editables are also visible. From our point of view, editing elements shouldn´t be possible with popups.

see http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11700

== Admin Documentation==

The document structure of the admin_doc templates is a mess (about every second template has a different structure). Therefore, we are not sure if it makes sense to style this section of the admin-interface.

Moreover, all admin-views lead to an error.

== !ModelAdmin Media Definitions==

There´s no distinction between Media for Change-Forms and Media for the Changelist. Therefore, if you define to load TinyMCE within your Model, it´s already loaded in the Changelist. The same goes for Stylesheets.

We think there should be distinctive Media-Classes for Change-Form and Changelist.
