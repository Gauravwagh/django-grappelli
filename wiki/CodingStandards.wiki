UI components have been broken down in encapsulated jQuery UI widgets.

== Folder structure ==

|| media/jquery/grappelli || Folder that contains all the grappelli code ||
|| media/jquery/grappelli/src || Source code, this is where you modify widgets ||
|| media/jquery/grappelli/dist || Contains the compressed/minified distribution files ||
|| media/jquery/grappelli/src || Source code, this is where you modify widgets ||
|| media/jquery/grappelli/src || Contains external libraries ||

== Build instruction ==

To compile and minify the source code use the following commands;

{{{

$: cd media/jquery/grappelli/
$: python build.py -m

}}}

This will generate the following files;

 * dist/jquery.grappelli.js
 * dist/jquery.grappelli.min.js

== Switching between droduction vs development code ==

Edit the file templates/admin/base.html to toggle between minified/merged and source code.

== Widget ==

=== structure ===

Here's a minimal bare bone widget boiler plate:

{{{
$.widget('ui.gWidgetName', {
    options: {
        autoSelector: '#changelist',
	speed: 0.5
    },
    _init: function() {
        var ui = this;
	alert(ui.options.spee); 
    }
});
}}}

Now here's a breakdown of what's going on line by line.

 # creating the widget, which will be callable via `$(selector).gWidgetName();`
 # setting up default options. These options can be overrided at initialization time: `$(selector).gWidgetName({spee: 1.0});`
 # `autoSelector` is a grappelli specific option used for widget autoloading
 # `speed` is a simple default option example
 # end options ..
 # obviously `_init` is called upon initialization.
 # grappelli widgets systematically use ui to refer at `this` for scope managing convenience.
 # will alert 0.5

=== Changing config after initialization ===

{{{
$(selector).gWidgetName('option', 'speed', 1.0);
}}}

== Global config manager ==

You can set and get global configurations with these methods;

{{{

$.grappelli.conf.set('Hello', 'World');

$.grappelli.conf.get('Hello'); // outputs 'World'

}}}
