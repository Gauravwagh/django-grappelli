*Why Grappelli?*

From our point of view, the Admin-Interface is one of the most important things for clients/customers and therefore it should just look amazing :-)

We tried to give the Admin-Interface a more "grown-up" look & feel and added some features.

*Why TinyMCE?*

Simple answer: Because there´s nothing better out there at the moment. This doesn´t mean we´re satisfied with TinyMCE.
----
*Why are there folders like css and css_grappelli, img and img_grappelli?*

Because, with just one line of code (changing base.css), you are able to switch from the original Django-Interface to Grappelli.
