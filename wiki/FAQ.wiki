*Why Grappelli?*

From our point of view, the Admin-Interface is one of the most important things for clients/customers and therefore it should just look amazing.

We tried to give the Admin-Interface a more "grown-up" and coherent look & feel and added some features.

*Why TinyMCE?*

With all the crappy Rich-Text-Editors out there, this one is ok (don´t ask how long it took to style the plug-in windows ...).
----
*Instead of just changing the original Django Admin-Interface, why is Grappelli not totally build up from scratch?*

Because if there are new features in the Admin-Interface, we are planning to integrate them as fast as possible using Grappelli. Therefore, Grappelli heavily relies on the Original Interface.

_This said, we´ve refactored most HTML/CSS-Files!_

*Who made Grappelli?*

Grappelli is based on the Original Django Admin-Interface by Wilson Miner (http://wilsonminer.com). Grappelli is made and maintained by Patrick Kranzlmüller and Axel Swoboda of vonautomatisch (http://vonautomatisch.at).
