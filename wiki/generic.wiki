=Visual Generic Relationships=

Making Generic Relations work/look like !ForeignKeys: When editing a Generic Relation, you first choose the Content Type and then the Object-ID. With Grappelli, you instantly get the related object displayed right near the Object-ID.

===All you have to do is add a js to your Admin===
{{{
class MyModelOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ...
    class Media:
        js = [
            '/media/admin/js/admin/Generic.js',
        ]
}}}
