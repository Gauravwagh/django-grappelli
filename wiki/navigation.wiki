With Grappelli, you get 2 additional Navigation Areas:
  # The *Shortcuts* at the top of every page - right beside the title.
  # The *Sidebar Navigation* at the Admin-Interface main page.

==Shortcuts==

Use *shortcuts.html* to place links for the most common pages. This can be a link to an Application or a link to a commonly used !ChangeList or whatever you´d like to have here ...

  * Open /templates/admin/includes_grappelli/shortcuts.html and change it.

==Sidebar Navigation==

The *Sidebar Navigation* can contain all different sections within your admin-site as well as links to external ressources. Please be aware that you have to *manually assign Editors* to each of the Navigation Items (because not every Editor needs the same Navigation).

Take a look at the fixtures to get a better idea of what´s this about.
