With Grappelli, you get 2 additional Navigation Areas:
  # The *Shortcuts* at the top of every page - right beside the title.
  # The *Navigation* at the Admin-Interface main page.

==Shortcuts==

Use *shortcuts.html* to place links for the most common pages. This can be a link to an Application or a link to a commonly used !ChangeList or whatever youÂ´d like to have here ...

  * Open /templates/admin/includes_grappelli/shortcuts.html and change it.

==Navigation==

Use "Navigation" in "Grappelli" to define and change your user-related Sidebar Items.
