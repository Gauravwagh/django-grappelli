With Grappelli, you get 2 additional Navigation Areas:
  # The *Shortcuts* at the top of every page - right beside the title.
  # The *Sidebar Navigation* at the Admin-Interface main page.

==Shortcuts==

The *Shortcuts* are user-defined bookmarks. Each user can add/remove specific admin-pages to this area. As a superuser, you can manage all shortcuts.

==Sidebar Navigation==

The *Sidebar Navigation* can contain all different sections within your admin-site as well as links to external ressources. Please be aware that you have to *manually assign Editors* to each of the Navigation Items (because not every Editor needs the same Navigation).

Take a look at the fixtures to get a better idea of whatÂ´s this about.
