=Customizing Navigation Areas=

With Grappelli, you get 2 additional Navigation Areas:
  # The *Bookmarks* at the top of every page - right beside the title.
  # The *Sidebar Navigation* at the Admin-Interface main page.

==Bookmarks==

Each user can add/remove specific admin-pages to this area and manage his/her Bookmarks.

As a superuser, you can manage all Bookmarks.

==Sidebar Navigation==

The *Sidebar Navigation* can/should contain all different sections/applications of your admin-site as well as links to external ressources. Please be aware that you have to *manually assign Editors* to each of the Navigation Items (because not every Editor needs the same Navigation).
