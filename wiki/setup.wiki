For using Grappelli, you have to ...

==Registering Models==

_Note: This is only relevant if you use different Admin Site Objects._

Grappelli assumes, that _every_ Model is registered with your *Main Admin Site*. This is necessary, because with the Original Django Admin-Interface, the Links for Related Lookups are _relative_. This means that you have to register _every_ Related Model within _every_ Admin Site Object (which is senseless, from my point of view). In order to avoid rewriting/customizing dozens of templates, we changed the Links for the Related Lookups to point to your Main Admin Site.

So, what actually _is_ your *Main Admin Site*? It´s the Admin Site Object where all your Models are registered, usually done with _admin.autodiscover()_. It´s important that you change *ADMIN_URL* within the Grappelli setttings accordingly.
